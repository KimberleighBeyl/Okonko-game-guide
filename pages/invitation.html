            <p>On the 9th of May around 10:00, Monday, Rowan found a mysterious QR code under the keyboard in the Yellow Labs at the University of Pretoria when he attended his IMY 300 class as usual. When the lecturer, Koos, arrived he said the Multimedia Blog website had been hacked but that they had fixed the site. Upon further inspection, Rowan found that the site had still been hacked and a user named “theowl” had posted a strange ascii art image with some cryptic riddles:</p>
            <p><strong>The gate has been revealed</strong> The key to the gate hidden in <strong>plain sight.</strong></p>
            <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/" alt="" /></a>
            <strong>The secret lies beneath your finger tips.</strong>But remember to keep it behind the correct key.</strong> Rowan noticed that there were ordinary letters within the ascii art and after sifting through the image discovered a URL: okonko.co.za.
