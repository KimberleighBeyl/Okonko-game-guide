            <p>Rowan saw an answer box and an image below with a riddle at the top. <strong>“At the beginning of November that which weighs the least shall lead to Oscar.”</strong> The image looked very similar to the graphs they had seen in computer science as it consisted of nodes with labelled connections. Being familiar with algorithms to process graphs, Rowan examined the riddle more closely. Rowan thought that “beginning of November” and “lead to Oscar” meant starting from node N and reaching node O. Rowan interpreted “weighs the least” as a clue that this was a weighted graph and from all the supporting clues this meant that he needed to find the shortest path from N to O. This would lead to the answer that needed to be input. After processing the graph the nodes that lead to O were NYANSAP and made up the word NYANSAPO. Rowan Googled the word as he wasn’t sure what it is or meant and found it was a “wisdom knot”: an African symbol that represented wisdom and more. Seeing that it resembled the graph itself he knew he must have been on the right track. Rowan felt this puzzle was very easy. After inputting this into the answer box, the site loaded an old style map and a button that said “good” on it. Rowan knew there was more behind this than met the eye. At this point, he chose to stop talking about it and followed the rules in the manifesto to keep it secret. </p>

            <p>Rowan discovered pieces of a story or some type of chat log hidden in the HTML of the webpage within comments within divs. A rather cryptic exchange happened between the Lion, Albatross, Owl and Leopard in 3 different sections of text hidden in comments.</p>

            <pre><code>
                Lion: The slumbering lion awakens to the calls of the animals.

                Lion: The Owl is silent. Why does he no longer hunt in the night?
                Albatross: The Owl worries for his mate. He starves himself for her.
                Lion: The Owl must be reminded of his place in the forest.
                Albatross: I will perch upon his branch the following moon.

                Lion: The slumbering lion awakens to the calls of the animals.
                Leopard: The leopard flicks its tail at the Northern Star.
                Lion: The birds’ calls grow ever fainter. Is there a snake among their nests?
                Leopard: There is a fire in the veld. It is consuming the fields in which our crops grow.
                Lion: This fire is destructive, we must extinguish it with haste.
                Leopard: Not all fire burns. This fire is comforting and is bringing new life.
                Lion: The embers have caught you. Why do you inhale the smoke which is ever so suffocating?
                Leopard: It is not suffocating. What you see as smoke I see as cleansing aether. It clears the mud you       in our eyes. Your time is at an end.
                Lion: We shall see. The lion yawns at the pale moon.
                Leopard: The leopard growls at the rustling leaves.

                Albatross: He has convinced the birds and animals that they are of his flock.
                Lion: What about you?
                Albatross: I am loyal to the king. 
                Lion: It is clear you are not the albatross. You are a chameleon.
                Albatross: No, why do you think that?
                Lion: Your response settles it, chameleon. Your blatant lies only sink you deeper into the sand. You will all
                see the extent of my wrath at this creation of chaos within our society. The lion yawns at the pale moon.
                Albatross: The albatross flies away.

                Rowan was presented with an audio file with the following riddle: “Forwards I am heavy, backwards I am not. Fast I am not but slow I should not be. The rise of tone makes me sing.” After downloading it, strange murmurs and distortion were heard. Following the clues, Rowan reversed the audio and speed up the tempo. It took him a while to change the pitch of the audio so that what was heard was made clear. He heard the answer: “2 days from now, at 6pm, be there”. Being that this puzzle was released on the 10th of May and the answer box was a date and time, he input “05/12/2016 6:00 PM” in and was shown another map and a button called “ongoing”. Rowan kept the date in mind as it must mean there was some meeting he must attend but he did not know of the location. The map, which was a portion of the campus map provided by UP to all its students, gave Rowan the impression that this would help him find the location of the meeting place. He compared the first map and the second map given and found they correlated with each other.

                Rowan wondered if the figures on the right of the first map which looked like 2 men indicated the location. Rowan kept it in mind.

                Rowan continued onto the third puzzle which showed a video with the following riddle above it: “To you appears the mundane but not all remains the same. As you count ticking clocks, so too are there 5 numbered stops.” In the video Rowan watched as someone filmed some ordinary student walk from the IT building past the labs to another entrance to the IT building for staff. He noticed that the cameraman would pan the camera at times. He easily figured out that he had to look out for some sort of numbers. He went through the video and found cut-outs of numbers stuck on surfaces hidden in the video that numbered: “92136” Once he input these numbers in, a loading symbol appeared with the text “Final Trials”. It then loaded the following image:
            </p>
            <a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/" alt="" /></a>
            <p>
                Like the other maps, it had a blue dashed border with a symbol pointing north. Rowan knew that they needed to be overlaid on each other and aligned correctly and that was where he and other possible participants in the trials needed to be on the 12th of May at 18:00. After doing so, Rowan knew it was the location shown at the end of the video and this confirmed that it was the right place.
